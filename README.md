# dwm - dynamic window manager

My own build of dwm for personal use on my Arch related desktops.

## My own customisations

### dwm-keys

It's a WIP utility that list's all keybindings (that can be described via provided help or are a spawn command) defined in `config.h`.

### spawncwd

It's a custom function provided by me to launch window with the same current working directory as selected window. Example uses are sitting in some directory in one terminal and launching new one in the same dir.
